        <h2>why is GOA the best?</h2>
        <p>GOA (Goal-Oriented Academy) is a programming academy, where kids learn how to write code and create websites. Once they learn web-development, they can choose between game development and computer security. Every month, we have Hackathons, which is a meeting, where students can compete in programming related kahoot quizzes and tough questions. There will be cash prizes for the winners.in one word GOA IS THE BEST.
